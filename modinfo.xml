	<Description>This mod expands the set of ballistic nato weapons by their soviet counterparts. Simply put, it makes it possible for players to equip their soldiers with soviet and nato weapons during the same campaign. The soviet weapons have identical ballistic stats to the nato weapons (the only significant difference is the enlarged size of magazines used by soviet rifles). The stats of the already existing AK-47 assault rifle has been changed: it has lower accuracy and range but better armour penetration and the ability to fire 5 rounds bursts. These facts make it an interesting option in close combat especially when facing armoured enemies like the androns. Besides all weapons added use a consistent colouring scheme.

Content:
- Makarov (weapon.pistol2)
- AK-47   (weapon.ak)
- AK-74   (weapon.rifle2)
- SWD     (weapon.sniper2)
- PK      (weapon.machinegun2)
- RPG-7   (weapon.rocketlauncher2)

Most the images (With exception of those for AK-74 and the ammunition) used in this mod are repainted/recoloured images provided by the original game (Xenonauts by Goldhawk Interactive).
